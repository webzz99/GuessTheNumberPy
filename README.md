##Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!


## How to play 

Upon accessing the app, you'll be greeted with a welcome message: "Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!!!"
Guessing Range:

The game has a predefined guessing range between lower_bound and upper_bound.
For example, if lower_bound is 1 and upper_bound is 1000, you'll need to guess a number between 1 and 1000.

##### Making a Guess:
The app will prompt you to enter your guess with a message like "Guess a number between [lower_bound] and [upper_bound]:"
Enter a numerical guess within the specified range.

##### Validation:
The app validates your guess. If your input is outside the range or not a valid number, you'll be prompted to enter a valid number.

##### Feedback:
After each guess, the app will provide feedback on whether your guess is correct or not.
If your guess is correct, you'll receive a congratulatory message like "Congratulations! You guessed correctly [secret_num] in [attempts] attempts."
If your guess is too low or too high, you'll be informed accordingly.

##### Game Over:
The game continues until you either guess the correct number or exhaust all your attempts.
If you run out of attempts without guessing correctly, the app will reveal the correct number and inform you that you've lost.

##### End of Game:
The app will display a message indicating whether you won or lost.
If you wish to play again, simply refresh the page or navigate to the provided Heroku app link.

##### Enjoy the Game!
The Number Guessing Game is designed for fun and entertainment. Challenge yourself to make strategic guesses and see how quickly you can find the correct number. If you have any questions or encounter issues, feel free to reach out.
